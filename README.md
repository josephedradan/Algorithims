# Algorithms
### Description
This repository has algorithms that I wrote to solve specific problems or to learn and understand.  

### Notes:
- This repo includes known algorithms and very specific algorithms to solve specific problems.
- The specific algorithms are custom algorithms I wrote to solve problems that my brain told me that I could solve if I just thought about it.

### Examples of algorithms

#### Wiki: [*Knuth's Algorithm X*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knuth%27s_Algorithm_X)
##### Algorithm: [*algorithm_x.py*](https://github.com/josephedradan/algorithms/blob/master/algorithms/optimization/algorithm_x/algorithm_x.py)

- A crude implementation of Algorithm X using the wiki as a reference.

### Examples of specific algorithms that solve problems

#### Video: [*Cooperative Games and the Shapley value*](https://youtu.be/w9O0fkfMkx0)
##### Algorithm: [*shapley_value.py*](https://github.com/josephedradan/algorithms/blob/master/algorithms/game_theory/shapley_value.py)
![shapley_value.png](../master/images/shapley_value.png)
- An algorithm that finds how much a individuals contributes to a cooperative activity.

##### Algorithm: [*find_all_possible_arithmetic_expressions_and_solve.py*](https://github.com/josephedradan/algorithms/blob/master/algorithms/find_all_possible_arithmetic_expressions_and_solve.py)
![find_all_possible_arithmetic_expressions_and_solve.png](../master/images/find_all_possible_arithmetic_expressions_and_solve.png)
- Brute force all possible permutations of operands, operators, and the order of operations to create an expression that equals the target number 24.
